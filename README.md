# InfiniteRecycleView
## + swipe to dismiss (direction depending)
## + "Undo" floating Action Button

For education purposes I give to you example demo how to implement :

  - **infinite RecycleView**
  - **swipe to dismiss (direction depending)**
  - **"Undo" floating Action Button**
  - 
### Version
1.0

### Tech

InfiniteRecycleView uses a number of android library to work properly:
* **com.android.support:design:22.2.1**
* **com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:22.2.1**
* **com.android.support:support-v4:22.2.1**

And of course InfiniteRecycleView itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/marosc/infiniteRecycleView) on GitHub.

### Installation
You need Git to download repository, or download ZIP archive

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] infiniterecycleview
```

You need Android SDK and Android Studio (or Eclipse ADT, ...) to build project.
