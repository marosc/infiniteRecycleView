### Tech

InfiniteRecycleView uses a number of android library to work properly:
* **com.android.support:design:22.2.1**
* **com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:22.2.1**
* **com.android.support:support-v4:22.2.1**

And of course InfiniteRecycleView itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/marosc/infiniteRecycleView) on GitHub.

### Installation
You need Git to download repository, or download ZIP archive

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] infiniterecycleview
```

You need Android SDK and Android Studio (or Eclipse ADT, ...) to build project.
